            *** NOT MAINTAINED ***

I haven't looked at this code in 2+ years, as I no longer use any Xfce
components. I believe Xfce has implemented something like this in its newer
versions, so this project now has little relevance.

            == About this project ==

In this project I am attempting to add extra configuration features to Xfce's
notification daemon, xfce4-notifyd (see git.xfce.org/apps/xfce4-notifyd/).

In the Xfce version, the notification always appears on the same monitor as
the mouse pointer. Call this mode=1.

I have added three more possibilities:
    mode=0 : to appear on the default screen's primary monitor if set,
                otherwise that screen's first monitor (new default mode)
    mode=2 : to appear on the same monitor as the window that has focus
    mode=3 : to appear on a fixed, user-configurable monitor

To define these behaviours I have added three new configuration settings.
They can now be set in the settings GUI xfce4-notifyd-config.

Or, to set these from the command line using xfconf-query:

  to set the mode:
    $ xfconf-query -c xfce4-notifyd -p /monitor-mode -n -t uint -s 2

  to set the screen number for fixed mode
    $ xfconf-query -c xfce4-notifyd -p /monitor-screen -n -t int -s 0

  to set the monitor name for fixed mode
    $ xfconf-query -c xfce4-notifyd -p /monitor-name -n -t string -s "VGA1"

The example above sets notification always on screen 0, monitor VGA1. You
can also use xfce4-settings-editor to add/edit these settings.

To select the primary monitor on a screen other than default, use mode=3
and enter * as the monitor name. If you're using xfconf-query, remember
to quote this.

To use the original mode, use mode=1. Output defaults to mode 0 if no monitor
can be chosen using the set mode.

The screen number and monitor name can be easily determined from the output
of the command:
    $ xrandr

Xfce Notify Daemon

The Xfce Notify Daemon (xfce4-notifyd for short) is a smallish program that
implements the "server-side" portion of the Freedesktop desktop notifications
specification.  Applications that wish to pop up a notification bubble in
a standard way can implicitly make use of xfce4-notifyd to do so by
sending standard messages over D-Bus using the org.freedesktop.Notifications
interface.


Requirements:

* gtk+ 2.14.0
* dbus 1.0.0
* dbus-glib 0.72
* libxfce4util 4.4.0
* libxfce4ui 4.7.0
* xfconf 4.6
* libnotify 0.7

Additionally, I'd recommend use with a compositing manager running; in that
case xfce4-notifyd will look a bit nicer and will be semi-transparent and
will fade out, and other nice pretty things.  This isn't required by any
means, of course.


Installation:

The usual:

./configure
make
make install

should work just fine.  Pass --prefix=/path/to/wherever to install in a
location other than /usr/local.

In order for xfce4-notifyd to be started automatically, you must have a
<servicedir> directive in your D-Bus session configuration file.  If you
install xfce4-notifyd to a standard prefix (like /usr), you shouldn't need
to worry about this.


Configuration:

Run xfce4-notifyd-config to display the settings dialog.  There aren't any
other tunables; if you don't see it in the settings dialog, it's not
changeable.


Theming:

Xfce4-notifyd uses gtk's standard theming system.  You can create new themes
by creating a normal gtkrc file.  See the example included themes for details
of how to reference the various widgets present in a normal notification
dialog.  You'll want to put your gtkrc file in
$HOME/.themes/THEMENAME/xfce4-notify-4.0 and then start up the configuration
dialog to set the theme.  If you think you've come up with a cool theme,
feel free to send it to me, and I'll be happy to include it in the next
release.  For themes shipped with xfce4-notifyd, I require all parts of them
to be redistributable under the terms of a license compatible with the GPLv2.
